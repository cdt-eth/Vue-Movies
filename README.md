## Movie fetcher using the Open Movie Database API

### [movies-vue.netlify.app](https://movies-vue.netlify.app/)

This project uses the [Open Movie Database API](http://www.omdbapi.com) to look up movie & show data like you would on IMDB. There’s a home, results, and movie detail screen. I’ve worked with React Router before, and Vue Router wasn’t too difficult to pick up. This was my favorite project of the three.
